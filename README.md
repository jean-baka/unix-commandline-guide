### To read more on Bash
For those of you who want to go a bit further, the definitive resource regarding Bash is the excellent [Advanced Bash Scripting Guide (ABS)](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/).


### More on sed
The [sed "grymoire" manual by Bruce Barnett](https://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sed.html) is one of the best online resources, with a step-by-step learning approach.

### More on awk
Most of us will use the GNU flavour of awk, and there is [an excellent manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html) about it. And anyway, there are no big differences between the original awk, nawk and gawk.
