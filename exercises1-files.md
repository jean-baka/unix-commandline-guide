## Basic commandline exercises: filesystem, cd and moving files, etc

In most cases, the questions below are independent of each other. Many questions accept different ways to address them (which means several "right answers").

  1. Suppose your current working directory is `/home/jb/Linux/Exercises/`. What is the command that will enable you to move to `/home/jb/Fun_stuff/`?

  2. How do you count the number of lines contained in a text file?

  3. You are in `/home/jb/`. Suppose this directory is empty. How do you create in only one command the whole path `/home/jb/Work/Sequencing/ONT/`?

  4. How do you access the help on a given command, for instance the help on `grep`?

  5. Which command would you use in order to create an empty file in the current directory, let's say empty.txt? 

  6. Suppose your current working directory contains a file named seqs.txt. How do you rename this file into sequences.fasta? Does this have any effect on the content of the file, and if yes, what does it do?

  7. In Unix, how does the extension of a file (the part of the filename after the dot) matter?

  8. In Unix, which command will *really* help you to determine the type of a file (i.e. its type of file content, e.g. whether it is a jpeg-compressed image or a pdf file)?

  9. How can you create in a single command a file containing the contents "Hello, world!" and named `universal_greeting.txt`?

  10. What about creating the same file but with filename "universal greeting.txt" (the filename contains a space)?

  11. In Bash, how do you redirect the output of a command so that it is not displayed on the screen but rather goes into a file?

  12. Try this with the command `expr 1 / 0`, whose purpose is to calculate the integer result of 1 divided by 0. What happens? Why?
